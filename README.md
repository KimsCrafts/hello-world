My Learning Place

This is my new place to learn things.  I love working with HTML coding, but with all the changes in recent years, I've lost touch with the HTML World.

My name is Kimberly Johnson.  I'm the mother of one (a son, Erick, who is my pride and joy).  I'm the owner of Kim's Jewelry & Crafts where I make and sell beaded jewelry and other crafts.  I'm also the author of a book of poetry called "The Thoughts of an Image Writer".  It is the first in a series of 7 books.

My book was a long work in progress, and it took me 38 years and many losses to finally publish my poems.  In the end, I wound up with a 175 page book, including a foreword by a now deceased friend, and many other pages besides the poems.  I published it first on Smashwords (where the original is at, but not the full book), and then I went over to CreateSpace and created the full book with photos included (where it's available on Amazon).  It was first published on CreateSpace in 2012, and I've revised it since then and added more pages, where the final count is 175.

My crafting has been being done since I was young.  I started out crocheting at an early age, and then upgraded to Macreme.  As I got older, I wanted to try out new things.  This is when I started doing cross-stitching, plastic canvas, painting, card making, scrapbooking, and finally my jewelry.  Although I still do all of my other crafts, my jewelry making has taken up a lot more of my time than I ever thought it would.

I have, over the years, changed the name of my store several times.  These changes have mainly been done due to the "length" of the names.  I have finally settled on Kim's Jewelry & Crafts.  By doing this, I'm not committed to just one style of my jewelry making, nor am I committed to one type of craft.

I have had many people offer to help me with my business site, but one person over the last year has brought me more help (without the "high pocket price") than anyone else over the last 17 years.  He's a young man (younger than me...lol) but has a lot of experience in this area.  His name is David.  Since first starting to talk to him, I have gotten to know that he cares about the people he helps, and really tries his best to work with them.

If it weren't for David over this last year, I don't think I'd be getting this new site up and running before Christmas.  I'd probably still be sitting her twiddling my thumbs trying to figure out the best way to put it together, without having to spend an arm and a leg to do it.  This is another way that he has come in handy.  He's given me a lot of help in places where I didn't have knowledge or help in the past.  He lets me know if something needs improvement, or if it needs taken down a bit.  He is, as he puts it, "strict" in a lot of ways.  But that's good.

He sees where I need improvement in my site, in my posts, in how I word things, in how I use tags (which is one of my biggest problems...LOL :).  I love using tags.  I've been told that the more you use, the easier it will be for the search engines to find you, well, with his help, I'm learning that isn't true.  Less, in this case, is absolutely more.

He's been a great help this past year, and I hope to be able to continue to work with him in the future as well.

Well, that's enough for now.  Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Kim
